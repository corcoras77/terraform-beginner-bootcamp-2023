    <h1>French Crêpe Recipe</h1>

    <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if desired). Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until the batter is smooth. Let it rest for about 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or crêpe pan over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of batter into the hot pan, swirling it to evenly coat the bottom.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 1-2 minutes until the edges start to lift and the crêpe is lightly browned on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Flip the crêpe using a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the other side is lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the crêpe from the pan and repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve your French crêpes hot with your favorite fillings, such as Nutella, strawberries, or whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade French crêpes!</p>
